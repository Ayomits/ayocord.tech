## TypeScript configuration

### Using path aliases

For setup path aliases you need past this to your tsconfig.json to `compilerOptions`

```json
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./src/*"]
}
```

Usually that's enough for comfort development however you can add more paths

```json
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["./src/*"],
  "@utils/*": ["./src/utils/*"],
  "@modules/*": ["./src/modules/*"],
  "@db/*": ["./src/db/*"],
}
```

## Use suffixes for filenames

Name your file using suffixes like `.module.ts`, `.type.ts`, `.view.ts`, `.model.ts` <br>
In ayocord it doesn't affect. All modules collected using decorator metadata, however it looks good <br>
This recomendation was taken from Nestjs

### Example (that's examples project for this documentation <3)

## Use separate directories for each module

In example upper you've seen all modules in one directory <br>
That's antipattern <br>

Use something like that instead:

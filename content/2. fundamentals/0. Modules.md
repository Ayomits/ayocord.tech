# Modules

Modules serve as **containers** for managing **Discord API interactions**, allowing you to organize and streamline your bot's functionality effectively.

> Important

<p>Do not define modules in the same file where you launch your application, as the framework will not be able to detect them.<br> Always use separate files for defining modules.<br> Most importantly, without modules, you cannot interact with the Discord API, and decorators alone will not function.</p>

## Understanding Modules

A module is a container designed to hold all WebSocket (WS) interactions within a single class. This structure makes your codebase more organized and easier to maintain by centralizing related functionality.

### Benefits of Using Modules

- **Centralization**: Group related commands, events, and interactions in one place.
- **Ease of Use**: Handle multiple interaction types (events, commands, components) without switching files.
- **Enhanced Organization**: Ideal for modular designs, like setup systems or feature-specific logic.

### Example: Creating a Module

Below is a comprehensive example of a module:

```typescript
import {
  Component,
  DiscordClient,
  Event,
  Module,
  SlashCommand,
  TextCommand,
} from "ayocord";
import {
  Events,
  SlashCommandBuilder,
  CommandInteraction,
  Message,
  ButtonInteraction,
} from "discord.js";

@Module({
  name: "ExampleModule", // The name of your module
})
export class ExampleModule {
  // Handles the ClientReady event
  @Event({ name: Events.ClientReady, once: true })
  async onClientReady(client: DiscordClient) {
    console.log("Bot is ready!");
  }

  // Slash command handler
  @SlashCommand({
    builder: new SlashCommandBuilder()
      .setName("greet")
      .setDescription("Greets the user"),
  })
  async handleSlashCommand(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
    return interaction.reply({ content: "Hello, user!" });
  }

  // Text command handler
  @TextCommand({ name: "ping", description: "Checks bot responsiveness" })
  async handleTextCommand(message: Message) {
    return message.reply({ content: "Pong!" });
  }

  // Component interaction handler
  @Component({ customId: "click-me" })
  async handleComponentInteraction(interaction: ButtonInteraction) {
    return interaction.reply({ content: "You clicked the button!" });
  }
}
```

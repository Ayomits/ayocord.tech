# Events

The `@Event` decorator is used to handle Discord.js events efficiently within your module. It allows you to define event listeners directly in your module classes, keeping your code organized and easy to maintain.

## Key Features

- **Event Binding**: Connects your method to a specific Discord.js event.
- **Options**: Supports additional configuration, such as setting the event to execute only once.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures any errors in your event handler are caught and logged.

## Usage Example

Hereâ€™s how you can use the `@Event` decorator in your module:

```typescript
import { Events } from "discord.js";
import { Event } from "ayocord";

export class ExampleModule {
  @Event({ name: Events.ClientReady, once: true })
  async onClientReady(client: DiscordClient) {
    console.log("Bot is ready!");
  }
}

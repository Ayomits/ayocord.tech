# Sub commands

> Important

<p>I really idk how to make it better and this solution looks like a crutch</p>

## Example

```ts
import { Module, SlashCommand } from "ayocord";
import { SubCommand } from "ayocord/dist/packages/interactions/decorators/sub-command.decorator";
import { CommandInteraction, SlashCommandBuilder } from "discord.js";

@Module({
  name: "SubCommandsModule",
})
export class SubCommandModule {
  @SlashCommand({
    builder: new SlashCommandBuilder()
      .setName("command")
      .setDescription("example")
      .addSubcommand((command) =>
        command.setName("interact").setDescription("interact with subcommand")
      ) as any, // I really hate djs typing <3,
  })
  async mainCommand(_interaction: CommandInteraction) {
    // do not interact here!!!
    // you will broke everything if write something here!!!
  }

  @SubCommand({
    // Parent name is a name that you define in new SlashCommandBuilder().setName("command")
    parentName: "command",
    /** The name is a name that you define in new SlashCommandBuilder().addSubcommand((command) =>
     *  command.setName("interact").setDescription("interact with subcommand")) as any
     */
    name: "interact",
  })
  async interactSubCommand(interaction: CommandInteraction) {}

  /**
   * If you use group of sub commands this example can be usefull
   */

  @SubCommand({
    // Parent name is a name that you define in new SlashCommandBuilder().setName("command")
    parentName: "command",
    // The same with parentName but with group of sub commands
    groupName: "group",
    /** The name is a name that you define in new SlashCommandBuilder().addSubcommand((command) =>
     *  command.setName("interact").setDescription("interact with subcommand")) as any
     */
    name: "interact",
  })
  async interactGroupSubCommand(interaction: CommandInteraction) {}
}
```
